# Finance Dashboard Project

## Introduction

In this project, you will build a finance dashboard using React and Vite. The dashboard will allow users to enter multiple stock purchases and display the current value and profit/loss for each stock. This project aims to reinforce your understanding of React concepts such as components, conditional rendering, props, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useContext), and state management.
